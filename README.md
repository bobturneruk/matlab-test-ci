# matlab-test-ci

## Purpose

For demonstration purposes only. This repository is intended to demonstrate 
testing, continuous integration and deployment with Matlab. It contains elements
 of good practise, but is not exemplary.

The software loads a file generated by a tensile test device. Functionality
 may be extended to calculate mechanical properties of the material under 
 test.
