[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/bobturneruk/matlab-test-ci/_apis/build/status/bobturneruk.matlab-test-ci?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/bobturneruk/matlab-test-ci/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/bobturneruk/matlab-test-ci/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/bobturneruk/matlab-test-ci)

## Purpose

For demonstration purposes only. This repository is intended to demonstrate 
testing, continuous integration and deployment with Matlab. It contains elements
 of good practise, but is not exemplary.

The software loads a file generated by a tensile test device. Functionality
 may be extended to calculate mechanical properties of the material under 
 test.

## Tests

Run the tests using:

```
runtests
```

## CI

To set this up on another project, you're going to need an Azure devops 
account and an organisation (mine is "bobturneruk"). You'll also need the 
[Matlab extension](https://uk.mathworks.com/solutions/continuous-integration.html).

## Packaging

[ToolboxPackagingConfiguration.prj](ToolboxPackagingConfiguration.prj) defines what 
goes in the toolbox. The toolbox can be built using:

```
matlab.addons.toolbox.packageToolbox("ToolboxPackagingConfiguration.prj")
```

This command is run as part of CI, but the toolbox is not uploaded anywhere.
